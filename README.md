# LabGuess
I will be using the various control statements of Java to write a simple number-guessing game. 
My game will include a secrete number between 1 and 100 and then proceed to prompt the player to guess the number.
If the player's guess is different from the secret number, the program will tell the player whether the guess was too high or too low. 
This will also include the number that was guessed by the player.
The game will also keep track of the number of guesses made by the player; 
when the player guesses the correct number, a message of congratulations will be displayed, along with the total number of guesses.
# Example Output
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100 ...

Please guess a number:50
50 is too high.
Please guess a number:25
25 is too low.
Please guess a number:30
30 is too high.
Please guess a number:27
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 4 guess(es)!
